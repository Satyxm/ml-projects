My Hypothesis

The Challenge was to utilize this small dataset and build something useful. So, i came up with an idea: A country ranked overall as #1, but did not won any ample amount of Gold medals. Instead, Japan won 40 Gold medals and it's total was 91. Whereas same amount of Gold medals were won by USA even though it won more medals overall than Japan. But then also Japan came out as "Gold Dominant" as shown in the Project.

TL;DR - I personally Learned a Lot of machine learning jargons and methods.
